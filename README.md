## Contribution Guidelines

To contribute, click the `ADD A TERM` button on the website, select the source and target languages, enter the translation, and click the `ADD` button at the bottom to submit. Once submitted, the term will be reviewed by a maintainer and published if deemed appropriate.

- Only add translations that are actually used in real-world contexts.
- Technical terms as well as commonly used slang and idioms are welcome. However, if a term carries a derogatory or disparaging meaning, that nuance **must be explicitly stated** in the description.
- Terms are grouped by topic, but strict adherence to categories is not required.
